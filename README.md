<h1>CS-Queue-Message-MakerðŸ“‹</h1>
<p>
    Hello! A year ago, I was in the queue for a
    web development course for #CS_Internship program, observing the group
    admins sending updates to the queue every week. I always thought there must
    be a professional tool to organize and arrange the queue efficiently. I
    joined the mentors' group, and now I was the admin sending queue updates. It
    seemed strange to me that this process was entirely manual, with no tool
    available for it. I realized that if I were asked to move someone from the
    front to the end of the queue, I would need to manually adjust the numbers
    of everyone behind them, ensuring no mistakes are made, and the spacing is
    consistent.
</p>

    A few weeks ago, I dedicated time to developing a solution for this issue,
    and now the project is complete. The program is named
    CS-Queue-Message-Maker, designed to streamline the process of creating queue
    updates. The program has a simple interface, and you can easily understand
    how to use it by reading the included "How to use" guide within the program.
